        """
        Class which gets 2D attributes and adds them to a `Visuals2D` objects, such that they are plotted on 2D figures.

        For a visual to be extracted and added for plotting, it must have a `True` value in its corresponding entry in
        the `Include2D` object. If this entry is `False`, the `GetVisuals2D.get` method returns a None and the
        attribute is omitted from the plot.

        The `GetVisuals2D` class adds new visuals to a pre-existing `Visuals2D` object that is passed to
        its `__init__` method. This only adds a new entry if the visual are not already in this object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        include
            Sets which 2D visuals are included on the figure that is to be plotted (only entries which are `True`
            are extracted via the `GetVisuals2D` object).
        visuals
            The pre-existing visuals of the plotter which new visuals are added too via the `GetVisuals2D` class.
