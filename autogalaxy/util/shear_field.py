    A regular shear field, which is collection of (y,x) vectors which are located on a uniform grid
    of (y,x) coordinates.

    The structure of this data structure is described in
    `autoarray.structures.vectors.uniform.VectorYX2D`

    This class extends `VectorYX2D` to include methods that are specific to a shear field, typically
    used for weak lensing calculations.

    This data structure is of shape [total_vectors, 2], where entries for [:,0] are the gamma_2 values and
    entries for [:,1] are the gamma_1 values.

    Note therefore that this convention means the FIRST entries in the array are the gamma_2 values and the SECOND
    entries are the gamma_1 values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vectors
        The 2D (y,x) vectors on an irregular grid that represent the vector-field.
