"""
Extends the **PyAutoArray** `SimulatorInterferometer` class with galaxy-aware simulation.

`SimulatorInterferometer` (from `autoarray`) handles the low-level simulation: applying a Fourier
transform and adding visibility noise. This module adds a `via_galaxies_from` method that takes a list
of `Galaxy` objects and a 2D grid, evaluates the galaxy images, and passes them to the parent
simulation pipeline.

        Returns a realistic simulated image by applying effects to a plain simulated image.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image
            The image before simulating (e.g. the lens and source galaxies before optics blurring and Imaging read-out).
        pixel_scales
            The scale of each pixel in arc seconds
        exposure_time_map
            An arrays representing the effective exposure time of each pixel.
        psf: PSF
            An arrays describing the PSF the simulated image is blurred with.
        add_poisson_noise_to_data: Bool
            If `True` poisson noise_maps is simulated and added to the image, based on the total counts in each image
            pixel
        noise_seed: int
            A seed for random noise_maps generation
