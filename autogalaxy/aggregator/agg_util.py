    """
    Returns the list of instances of the maximum likelihood model, depending on the model composition and whether
    multiple `Analysis` objects were fitted simultaneously.

    This if loop accounts for 4 scenarios:

    - A single `Analysis` object was fitted, in which case the instance is a single object and converted to a list.

    - Multiple `Analysis` objects were fitted via a `FactorGraphModel`, in which case the instance is a list of
    objects and all but the last object (which is the overall `FactorGraphModel` are returned.

    - A single instance is manually input, in which case it is converted to a list.

    - Multiple `Analysis` objects were fitted via a `FactorGraphModel`, in which case the instance is a list of
    objects and all but the last object (which is the overall `FactorGraphModel` are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A `PyAutoFit` `Fit` object which contains the results of a model-fit as an entry which has been loaded from
        an output directory or from an sqlite database.
    instance
        An optional instance that overwrites the max log likelihood instance in fit (e.g. for drawing the instance
        randomly from the PDF).

    The list of instances of the maximum likelihood model.

    Updates adaptive images when loading the galaxies from a `PyAutoFit` loaded directory `Fit` or sqlite

    """
    Returns the image-plane pixelization grid(s) used by the fit.

    A subset of image-mesh objects (e.g. `Hilbert`, `KMeans`) create the grid of points that act as the mesh
    centres (e.g. the centers of Voronoi cells) in the image-plane. For lensing calculations this may then be
    traced to the source-plane to form the pixelization.

    This calculation can depend on the library used to determine the image-plane grid and may have a random element
    associated with it. This means that performing an analysis on a super computer and then downloading the results
    for inspection on your laptop may produce different image-plane grids, changing the result and quantities like
    the `log_likelihood`.

    By storing this grid as a result in the `files` folder and loading it via the database before creating a fit
    this possible mismatch is removed, ensuring results on a local computer are identical to those computer elsewhere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A `PyAutoFit` `Fit` object which contains the results of a model-fit as an entry which has been loaded from
        an output directory or from an sqlite database..
    total_fits
        The total number of `Analysis` objects summed to create the fit.
    use_preloaded_grid
        Certain pixelization's construct their mesh in the source-plane from a stochastic KMeans algorithm. This grid
        may be output to hard-disk after the model-fit and loaded via the database to ensure the same grid is used
        as the fit.

    Returns
    -------
    The list of image-plane mesh centres used when creating the overall fit.

    """
    Returns a `Preloads` object associated with a fit loaded via the database.

    When loading results via the database, the preloads class may have certain attributes associated with it
    in order to perform the fit. The main purpose is to use the same image-plane mesh centres for pixelization where
    the mesh is computed in the image-plane (see `agg_util.mesh_grids_of_planes_list_from`).

    The preloads may also switch off `w_tilde` so fits are computed faster locally as they do not need to recompute
    w_tilde.

    preloads_cls
