    """
    Returns a list of `FitImaging` objects from a `PyAutoFit` loaded directory `Fit` or sqlite database `Fit` object.

    The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
    attributes of the fit:

    - The imaging data, noise-map, PSF and settings as .fits files (e.g. `dataset/data.fits`).
    - The mask used to mask the `Imaging` data structure in the fit (`dataset.fits[hdu=0]`).
    - The settings of inversions used by the fit (`dataset/settings_inversion.json`).

    Each individual attribute can be loaded from the database via the `fit.value()` method.

    This method combines all of these attributes and returns a `FitImaging` object for a given non-linear search sample
    (e.g. the maximum likelihood model). This includes associating adapt images with their respective galaxies.

    If multiple `FitImaging` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
    is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
    `FitImaging` objects.

    The settings of an inversion can be overwritten by inputting a `settings_inversion` object, for example
    if you want to use a grid with a different inversion solver.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A `PyAutoFit` `Fit` object which contains the results of a model-fit as an entry which has been loaded from
        an output directory or from an sqlite database..
    instance
        A manual instance that overwrites the max log likelihood instance in fit (e.g. for drawing the instance
        randomly from the PDF).
    settings_inversion
        Optionally overwrite the `SettingsInversion` of the `Inversion` object that is created from the fit.

        """
            Interfaces with an `PyAutoFit` aggregator object to create instances of `FitImaging` objects from the results
            of a model-fit.

            The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
        attributes of the fit:

            - The imaging data, noise-map, PSF and settings as .fits files (e.g. `dataset/data.fits`).
            - The mask used to mask the `Imaging` data structure in the fit (`dataset.fits[hdu=0]`).
            - The settings of inversions used by the fit (`dataset/settings_inversion.json`).

            The `aggregator` contains the path to each of these files, and they can be loaded individually. This class
            can load them all at once and create an `FitImaging` object via the `_fit_imaging_from` method.

            This class's methods returns generators which create the instances of the `FitImaging` objects. This ensures
            that large sets of results can be efficiently loaded from the hard-disk and do not require storing all
            `FitImaging` instances in the memory at once.

            For example, if the `aggregator` contains 3 model-fits, this class can be used to create a generator which
            creates instances of the corresponding 3 `FitImaging` objects.

            If multiple `Imaging` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
            is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
            `FitImaging` objects.

            This can be done manually, but this object provides a more concise API.

            Parameters
            ----------
            aggregator
                A `PyAutoFit` aggregator object which can load the results of model-fits.
            settings_inversion
                Optionally overwrite the `SettingsInversion` of the `Inversion` object that is created from the fit.

        Parameters
        ----------
        aggregator
            A `PyAutoFit` aggregator object which can load the results of model-fits.

            Optionally overwrite the `SettingsInversion` of the `Inversion` object that is created from the fit.
