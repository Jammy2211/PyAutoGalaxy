        """
        A basis is a collection of multiple light or mass profiles that are used to represent the light or mass
        distribution of a galaxy.

        A basis is typically used to decompose a galaxy's light or mass distribution into many profiles, each of
        which fit a small part of the overall light or mass distribution.

        For example, a common basis uses of order 10-100 Gaussian light or mass profiles, where each Gaussian
        represents a small part of the overall light or mass distribution of a galaxy. By decomposing the light or mass
        distribution into many profiles, more detailed structures can be captured and fitted that ordinary profiles
        would struggle to capture.

        This contrasts most standard light profiles (e.g. a Sersic) or mass profiles (e.g. an Isothermal) which
        represent the entire light or mass distribution of a galaxy.

        Parameters
        ----------
        profile_list
            The light or mass profiles that make up the basis.
        regularization
            The regularization scheme applied to the basis, which is used to regularize the solution to the linear
            inversion that fits the basis to the data.
