        The elliptical Moffat light profile, which is commonly used to model the Point Spread Function of
        Astronomy observations.

        This form of the MOffat profile is a reparameterizaiton of the original formalism given by

        Parameters
        ----------
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of the profile centre.
        ell_comps
            The first and second ellipticity components of the elliptical coordinate system.
        intensity
            Overall intensity normalisation of the light profile (units are dimensionless and derived from the data
            the light profile's image is compared too, which is expected to be electrons per second).
        alpha
            Scales the overall size of the Moffat profile and for a PSF typically corresponds to the FWHM / 2.
        beta
            Scales the wings at the outskirts of the Moffat profile, where smaller values imply heavier wings and it
            tends to a Gaussian as beta goes to infinity.
