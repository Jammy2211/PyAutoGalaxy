        Parameters
        ----------
        n
            The n order of the shapelets basis function.
        m
            The m order of the shapelets basis function in the x-direction.
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of the profile (shapelet) centre.
        ell_comps
            The first and second ellipticity components of the elliptical coordinate system.
        intensity
            Overall intensity normalisation of the light profile (units are dimensionless and derived from the data
            the light profile's image is compared too, which is expected to be electrons per second).
        beta
            The characteristic length scale of the shapelet basis function, defined in arc-seconds.
