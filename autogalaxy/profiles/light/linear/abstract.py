class LightProfileLinear(LightProfile):
    """
    A linear light profile, which is a light profile whose `intensity` value is solved for via linear algebra
    using an inversion.

    Every standard light profile (e.g. `Serisic`, `Exponential`, etc.) has a linear light profile equivalent that
    behaves identically, except that the `intensity` is not explicitly set by the user but instead is inferred via
    a linear inversion.

    This means that when a linear light profile is used to perform a model-fit, it reduces the number of free parameters
    in the model-fit by 1, as the `intensity` parameter is inferred via the inversion.

    The `LightProfileLinear` class is an abstract class that should be used to make specific linear light profiles.
    This inheritance is used throughout the `galaxy.py`, `tracer.py` and other modules to extract linear light
    profiles when performing a fit to data.

        standard light profile, where the input `intensity` is the value solved for in the linear inversion.

        This function is used to determine the parent class of the linear light profile that is used to create the
        standard light profile.

        This function also maps linear light and mass profiles to their standard light and mass profile counterparts.
        This specific mapping is required because their inheritence structure is different to the other light profiles.
        In the future, the ugly dictionary used to do this mapping should be removed for better code.

        """
        A list of linear light profiles which fits a dataset via linear algebra using the images of each linear light
        profile and the dataset.

        By inheriting from `AbstractLinearObjFuncList` this tells the parent project PyAutoArray that this class is a
        linear object that can be used in a linear inversion via its `Inversion` object. This means the linear light
        profiles are used to perform a linear inversion to fit the data, which solves for the `intensity` of each light profile.

        By overwriting the `mapping_matrix` function with a method that fills in each column of the matrix with the
        image of each linear light profile, this is then passed through the `inversion` package to perform the
        linear inversion. The API is identical to `Mapper` objects such that linear functions can easily be combined
        with mappers.

        The autoarray inversion module treats separely the `mapping_matrix` and the `operated_mapping_matrix`,
        where the latter is the mapping matrix after all additional operations (e.g. convolution, FFT) have been applied.
        The `operated_mapping_matrix` is used to perform the linear inversion. This class defines a function
        `operated_mapping_matrix_override` which overrides the `operated_mapping_matrix` calculation in autoarray
        to account for PSF convolution of the light profile images.

        This is a slightly weird design, is is required because although the autoarray inversion module has
        functionality to convolve ta `mapping_matrix` with a PSF in order to compute the `operated_mapping_matrix`,
        it does not have functionality to account for the fact that the light profile images have flux outside the
        masked region which is blurred into the masked region.

        For example, in `PyAutoGalaxy` and `PyAutoLens` the light of galaxies is represented using `LightProfile`
        objects, which describe the surface brightness of a galaxy as a function. By grouping lists of these linear
        light profiles into this class, autoarray solves for their intensity's linearly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid
            The (y,x) grid aligned with the data that is fitted, which is used to evaluate the image of each light
            profile.
        blurring_grid
            The blurring grid is all points whose light is outside the data's mask but close enough to the mask that
            it may be blurred into the mask. This is also used when evaluating the image of each light profile.
        psf
            The psf used to blur the light profile images of each light profile, the output of which
            makes up the columns of the `operated_mapping matrix`.
        light_profile_list
            A list of the linear light profiles that are used to fit the data via linear algebra.
        regularization
            The regularization scheme which may be applied to this linear object in order to smooth its solution.
