        """
        Abstract base class for an elliptical light-profile.

        Each light profile has an analytic equation associated with it that describes its 1D surface brightness.

        Given an input grid of 1D or 2D (y,x) coordinates the light profile can be used to evaluate its surface
        brightness in 1D or as a 2D image.

        Associated with a light profile is a spherical or elliptical geometry, which describes its `centre` of
        emission and ellipticity. Geometric transformations are performed by decorators linked to the **PyAutoArray**
        `geometry` package.

        Parameters
        ----------
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of the profile centre.
        ell_comps
            The first and second ellipticity components of the elliptical coordinate system (see the module
            `autogalaxy -> convert.py` for the convention).

        Returns the light profile's 2D image from a 2D grid of Cartesian (y,x) coordinates, which may have been
        transformed using the light profile's geometry.

        If the coordinates have not been transformed to the profile's geometry (e.g. translated to the
        profile `centre`), this is performed automatically.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid
            The 2D (y, x) coordinates in the original reference frame of the grid.

        Returns
        -------
        image

        coordinate from the light profile `centre`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_radii

        """
        Returns the light profile's 1D image from a grid of Cartesian coordinates, which may have been
        transformed using the light profile's geometry.

        If a 1D grid is input the image is evaluated every coordinate on the grid. If a 2D grid is input, this is
        converted to a 1D grid by aligning with the major-axis of the light profile's elliptical geometry.

        Internally, this function uses a 2D grid to compute the image, which is mapped to a 1D data structure on return
        via the `project_grid` decorator. This avoids code repetition by ensuring that light profiles only use
        their `image_2d_from()`  function to evaluate their image.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid
            A 1D or 2D grid of coordinates which are used to evaluate the light profile in 1D.

        Returns
        -------
        image
            The 1D image of the light profile evaluated at every (x,) coordinate on the 1D transformed grid.

        The `intensity` of a light profile is in dimension units, which are given physical meaning when the light
        profile is compared to data with physical units. The luminosity output by this function therefore is also
        dimensionless until compared to data.

        Parameters
