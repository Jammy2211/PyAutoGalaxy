        """
        Abstract base class for an elliptical light-profile.

        Each light profile has an analytic equation associated with it that describes its 1D surface brightness.

        Given an input grid of 1D or 2D (y,x) coordinates the light profile can be used to evaluate its surface
        brightness in 1D or as a 2D image.

        Associated with a light profile is a spherical or elliptical geometry, which describes its `centre` of
        emission and ellipticity. Geometric transformations are performed by decorators linked to the **PyAutoArray**
        `geometry` package.

        Parameters
        ----------
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of the profile centre.
        ell_comps
            The first and second ellipticity components of the elliptical coordinate system (see the module
            `autogalaxy -> convert.py` for the convention).

        Returns the light profile's 2D image from a 2D grid of Cartesian (y,x) coordinates, which may have been

        profile is compared to data with physical units. The luminosity output by this function therefore is also
        dimensionless until compared to data.
