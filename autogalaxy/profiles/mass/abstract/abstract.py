"""
Abstract base class for all mass profiles in **PyAutoGalaxy** and **PyAutoLens**.

A mass profile describes the projected mass distribution of a galaxy and exposes three fundamental lensing
quantities:

- `deflections_yx_2d_from` — the deflection angles α(θ) that describe how light rays are bent.
- `convergence_2d_from` — the dimensionless surface mass density κ(θ) = Σ(θ) / Σ_cr.
- `potential_2d_from` — the lensing (Shapiro) potential ψ(θ).

Every other lensing observable (shear, magnification, critical curves, Einstein radius, Fermat potential) can
be derived from these three quantities. See the `autogalaxy.operate.lens_calc` module for the `LensCalc` class
that derives these secondary quantities.

        Parameters
        ----------
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of the profile centre.

    def deflections_yx_2d_from(self, grid):

        Returns the 2D deflection angles of the mass profile from a 2D grid of Cartesian (y,x) coordinates.

        The deflection angle α(θ) at image-plane position θ describes how a light ray is bent by the
        gravitational field of the lens. The source-plane position β is then:

            β = θ − α(θ)

        Deflection angles are the single most important output of a mass profile — every other lensing quantity
        (convergence, shear, magnification, critical curves, caustics) can be derived from them.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid
            The 2D (y, x) coordinates where the deflection angles are evaluated.

        Returns

    def deflections_2d_via_potential_2d_from(self, grid):
        """
        Returns the 2D deflection angles of the mass profile by numerically differentiating the lensing
        potential on the input grid.

        This is a fallback implementation that computes deflection angles as the gradient of the potential via
        finite differences:

            α_y = ∂ψ/∂y,  α_x = ∂ψ/∂x

        Most concrete mass profiles override `deflections_yx_2d_from` with an analytic expression. This
        method is provided for cross-checking and for profiles where only the potential is known analytically.

        Parameters

        Returns the 2D convergence of the mass profile from a 2D grid of Cartesian (y,x) coordinates.

        The convergence κ(θ) is the dimensionless surface mass density of the lens, defined as the projected
        surface mass density Σ(θ) divided by the critical surface mass density Σ_cr:

        Returns the 2D lensing potential of the mass profile from a 2D grid of Cartesian (y,x) coordinates.

        The lensing potential ψ(θ) is the gravitational (Shapiro) time-delay term. It quantifies how much the
        passage of light through the gravitational field delays its arrival relative to a straight-line path in
        empty space.

        The potential enters directly into the Fermat potential:

            φ(θ) = ½ |θ − β|²  −  ψ(θ)
