    omega (e.g. can be used as a drop in replacement for the exp(i * phi) * special.hyp2f1

    Parameters
    ----------
    eiphi:
        `exp(i * phi)` where `phi` is the elliptical angle of the profile
    slope:
        The density slope of the power-law (lower value -> shallower profile, higher value
        -> steeper profile).
    factor:
        The second flattening of and ellipse with axis ration q give by `f = (1 - q) / (1 + q)`
    n_terms:
        The number of terms to calculate for the series expansion, defaults to 20 (this should
        be sufficient most of the time)
