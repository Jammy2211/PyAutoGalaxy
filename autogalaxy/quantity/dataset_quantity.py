        """
        A quantity dataset, which represents a derived quantity of a light profile, mass profile, galaxy or galaxies
        that can be fitted with a model via a non-linear.

        For example, the `DatasetQuantity` could represent the `convergence` of a mass profile, and this dataset could
        then be fit with a galaxies via the `AnalysisQuantity` class. The benefit of doing this is that the components
        of different models can be fitted to one another and matched for example, the power-law model whose convergence
        best matches the convergence of a dark matter profile could be inferred).

        The following quantities of the data are available and used for the following tasks:

        - `data`: The quantity data, which shows the signal that is analysed and fitted with a model data of a model
        object.

        - `noise_map`: The RMS standard deviation error in every pixel, which is used to compute the chi-squared value
        and likelihood of a fit.

        Datasets also contains following properties:

        - `grid`: A grids of (y,x) coordinates which align with the image pixels, whereby each coordinate corresponds to
        the centre of an image pixel. This may be used in fits to calculate the model image of the imaging data.

        - `grid_pixelization`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which align with the pixels of a pixelization. This grid
        is specifically used for pixelizations computed via the `invserion` module, which often use different
        oversampling and sub-size values to the grid above.

        The `over_sampling` and `over_sampling_pixelization` define how over sampling is performed for these grids.

        This is used in the project PyAutoGalaxy to load imaging data of a galaxy and fit it with galaxy light profiles.
        It is used in PyAutoLens to load imaging data of a strong lens and fit it with a lens model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            The data of the quantity (e.g. 2D convergence, 2D potential, 2D deflections) that is fitted.
        noise_map
            The 2D noise map of the quantity's data.
        noise_map
            An array describing the RMS standard deviation error in each pixel used for computing quantities like the
            chi-squared in a fit, which is often chosen in an arbitrary way for a quantity dataset given the quantities
            are not observed using real astronomical instruments.
        over_sampling
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which performs calculations not associated with a pixelization.
            In PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens this is light profile calculations.
        over_sampling_pixelization
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which is associated with a pixelization, which is therefore
            passed into the calculations performed in the `inversion` module.
