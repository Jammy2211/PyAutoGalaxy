        """
        After the non-linear search of a fit to a dataset is complete it creates a `Result` object which includes:

        - The samples of the non-linear search (E.g. MCMC chains, nested sampling samples) which are used to compute
        the maximum likelihood model, posteriors and other properties.

        - The model used to fit the data, which uses the samples to create specific instances of the model (e.g.
        an instance of the maximum log likelihood model).

        - The non-linear search used to perform the model fit.

        This class contains a number of methods which use the above objects to create the max log likelihood `Plane`,
        `FitIamging`, hyper-galaxy images,etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        samples
            A PyAutoFit object which contains the samples of the non-linear search, for example the chains of an MCMC
            run of samples of the nested sampler.
        model
            The PyAutoFit model object, which includes model components representing the galaxies that are fitted to
            the imaging data.
        analysis
            The `Analysis` object that was used to perform the model-fit from which this result is inferred.
        search
            The non-linear search used to perform this model-fit.

        Returns
        -------
        ResultImaging
            The result of fitting the model to the imaging dataset, via a non-linear search.
