        It is common for the model to have components whose parameters are all fixed, and thus the way that component
        fits the data does not change. For example, if all parameter associated with the light profiles of galaxies
        in the model are fixed, the image generated from these galaxies will not change irrespective of the model
        parameters chosen by the non-linear search.

        Preloading exploits this to speed up the log likelihood function, by inspecting the model and storing in memory
        quantities that do not change. For the example above, the image of all galaxies would be stored in memory and
        to perform every fit in the `log_likelihood_funtion`.

        This function sets up all preload quantities, which are described fully in the `preloads` modules. This
