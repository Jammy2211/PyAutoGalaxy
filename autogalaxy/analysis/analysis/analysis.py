        This abstract Analysis class for all model-fits which fit galaxies, but does not perform a model-fit by
        itself (and is therefore only inherited from).

        This class stores the Cosmology used for the analysis and adapt images used for certain model classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cosmology
            The Cosmology assumed for this analysis.

        the single list of galaxies used to fit the dataset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters may have been set

        After the non-linear search is complete create its `Result`, which includes:

          the maximum likelihood model, posteriors and other properties.

        - The model used to fit the data, which uses the samples to create specific instances of the model (e.g.
          an instance of the maximum log likelihood model).

        - The non-linear search used to perform the model fit.

        The `ResultImaging` object contains a number of methods which use the above objects to create the max
        log likelihood galaxies `FitImaging`, adapt-galaxy images,etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        samples
            A PyAutoFit object which contains the samples of the non-linear search, for example the chains of an MCMC
            run of samples of the nested sampler.
        search
            The non-linear search used to perform this model-fit.

        This function is optionally called throughout a model-fit to profile the log likelihood function.

        All function calls inside the `log_likelihood_function` that are decorated with the `profile_func` are timed
        with their times stored in a dictionary called the `run_time_dict`.

        An `info_dict` is also created which stores information on aspects of the model and dataset that dictate
        run times, so the profiled times can be interpreted with this context.

        The results of this profiling are then output to hard-disk in the `preloads` folder of the model-fit results,
        which they can be inspected to ensure run-times are as expected.

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set
            via a non-linear search).
        paths
