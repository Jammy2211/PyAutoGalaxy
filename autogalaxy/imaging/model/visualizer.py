            visualization and the pickled objects used by the aggregator output by this function.

        """
        Output images of the maximum log likelihood model inferred by the model-fit. This function is called throughout
        the non-linear search at regular intervals, and therefore provides on-the-fly visualization of how well the
        model-fit is going.

        The visualization performed by this function includes:

        - Images of the best-fit galaxies, including the images of each of its galaxies.

        - Images of the best-fit `FitImaging`, including the model-image, residuals and chi-squared of its fit to
          the imaging data.

        - The adapt-images of the model-fit showing how the galaxies are used to represent different galaxies in
          the dataset.

        The images output by this function are customized using the file `config/visualize/plots.yaml`.

        Parameters

        paths
