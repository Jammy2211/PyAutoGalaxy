        class representing an ellispe, which is used to perform ellipse fitting to 2D data (e.g. an image).

        The elliptical components (`ell_comps`) of this profile are used to define the `axis_ratio` (q)
        and `angle` (\phi) :


        :math: \phi = (180/\pi) * arctan2(e_y / e_x) / 2
        :math: f = sqrt(e_y^2 + e_x^2)
        :math: q = (1 - f) / (1 + f)

        Where:

        e_y = y elliptical component = `ell_comps[0]`
        e_x = x elliptical component = `ell_comps[1]`
        q = axis_ratio (major_axis / minor_axis)

        This means that given an axis-ratio and angle the elliptical components can be computed as:

        :math: f = (1 - q) / (1 + q)
        :math: e_y = f * sin(2*\phi)
        :math: e_x = f * cos(2*\phi)

        """
        Returns the total number of points on the ellipse based on the resolution of the data that the ellipse is
        fitted to and interpolated over.

        This value is chosen to ensure that the number of points computed matches the number of pixels in the data
        which the ellipse interpolates over. If the ellipse is bigger, the number of points increases in order to
        ensure that the ellipse uses more of the data's pixels.

        To determine the number of pixels the ellipse's circular radius in units of pixels is required. This is
        why `pixel_scale` is an input parameter of this function and other functions in this class.

        For computational efficiency, the maximum number of points is capped at 500, albeit few datasets will have
        more than 500 pixels in their 2D data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixel_scale
            The pixel scale of the data that the ellipse is fitted to and interpolated over.

        Returns

        """
        Returns the angles from the x-axis to a discrete number of points ranging from 0.0 to 2.0 * np.pi radians.

        These angles are therefore not linked to the properties of the ellipse, they are just the angles from the
        x-axis to a series of points on a circle.

        They are subtracted by the `angle` of the ellipse to give the angles from the major-axis of the ellipse.

        The final angle, which is 2.0 * np.pi radians, is a repeat of the first angle of zero radians, therefore
        the final angle is removed.

        The number of angles computed is the minimum of 500 and the integer of the circular radius of the ellipse.
        This value is chosen to ensure that the number of angles computed matches the number of pixels in the
        data that the ellipse is being fitted to.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixel_scale
            The pixel scale of the data that the ellipse is fitted to and interpolated over.
        n_i

            value is used to change the range of angles computed.
