The ``mass`` folder contains configuration files for the default priors assumed for mass profiles in **PyAutoGalaxy**.

Folders
-------

- ``dark``: Configs for mass profiles that typically represent dark matter (e.g. ``NFW``, ``gNFW``).
- ``stellar``: Configs for mass profiles that typically represent stellar matter (e.g. ``Sersic`, ``Gaussian``).
- ``total``: Configs for mass profiles that typically represent the total (e.g. stellar and dark matter) mass distribution (e.g. ``Isothermal`, ``PowerLaw``).
- ``sheets``: Configs for mass profiles that represent sheet-like mass components (e.g. ``ExternalShear`, ``MassSheet``).
