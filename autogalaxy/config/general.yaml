psf:
  use_fft_default: true              # If True, PSFs are convolved using FFTs by default, which is faster and uses less memory in all cases except for very small PSFs, False uses direct convolution.
grid:

test:
  check_likelihood_function: true   # if True, when a search is resumed the likelihood of a previous sample is recalculated to ensure it is consistent with the previous run.
