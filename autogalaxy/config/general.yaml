psf:
  use_fft_default: true              # If True, PSFs are convolved using FFTs by default, which is faster and uses less memory in all cases except for very small PSFs, False uses direct convolution.
updates:

  iterations_per_full_update: 1e99  # Non-linear search iterations between every full update, which outputs all visuals and result fits (e.g. model.result, search.summary), this exits the search and can be slow.
hpc:

test:
