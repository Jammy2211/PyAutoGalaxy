            The type of grid used to create the image from the *Galaxy* and *Plane*. The options are *Grid*,

            The options are *Grid*, *GridIterate* and *GridInterpolate* (see the *Grids* documentation for a
            description of these options).
        sub_size : int

        fractional_accuracy : float
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a *GridIterate*, this sets the fractional accuracy it
            uses when evaluating functions.
        sub_steps : [int]
            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a *GridIterate*, this sets the steps the sub-size is increased by
            to meet the fractional accuracy when evaluating functions.

            If the grid and / or grid_inversion use a *GridInterpolate*, this sets the resolution of the interpolation
            grid.

            If input, the dataset's noise-map is rescaled such that no pixel has a signal-to-noise above the
