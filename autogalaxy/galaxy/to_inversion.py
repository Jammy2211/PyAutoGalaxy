        Abstract class which interfaces a dataset and input modeling object (e.g. galaxies, a tracer) with the
        inversion module. to setup a linear algebra calculation.

        The galaxies may contain linear light profiles whose `intensity` values are solved for via linear algebra in
        order to best-fit the data. In this case, this class extracts the linear light profiles, of all galaxies,
        computes their images and passes them to the `inversion` module such that they become the  `mapping_matrix`
        used in the linear algebra calculation.

        The galaxies may also contain pixelizations, which use a mesh (e.g. a Voronoi mesh) and regularization scheme
        to reconstruct the galaxy's light. This class extracts all pixelizations and uses them to set up `Mapper`
        objects which pair the dataset and pixelization to again set up the appropriate `mapping_matrix` and
        other linear algebra matrices (e.g. the `regularization_matrix`).

        This class does not perform the inversion or compute any of the linear algebra matrices itself. Instead,
        it acts as an interface between the dataset and galaxies and the inversion module, extracting the
        necessary information from galaxies and passing it to the inversion module.

        The modeling object may also contain standard light profiles which have an input `intensity` which is not
        solved for via linear algebra. These profiles should have already been evaluated and subtracted from the
        dataset before the inversion is performed. This is how an inversion is set up in the fit
        modules (e.g. `FitImaging`).

        """
        Returns a dictionary associating each list of linear light profiles with the galaxy they belong to.

        This function iterates over all galaxies and their light profiles, extracting their linear light profiles and
        for each galaxy grouping them into a `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList` object, which is associated with the
        galaxy via the dictionary.

        This `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList` object contains the attributes (e.g. the data `grid`, `light_profiles`)
        and functionality (e.g. a `mapping_matrix` method) that are required to perform the inversion. It is
        in this method that the `image_2d_from` method of each light profile is used to compute the linear algebra
        matrices.

        Special behaviour is implemented for the case where a galaxy has a `Basis` object, which contains a list
        of light profiles grouped into one object (e.g. when performing a multi Gaussian expansion where 30+ linear
        light profile Gaussians are often used). In this case, the function extracts all linear light profiles from
        the `Basis` object and associates them with the galaxy.

        It is expected that only two inputs are passed into the `cls` parameter, either `LightProfileLinear` or `Basis`.
        However, a specific linear light profile class (e.g. `Sersic`) could be input if extracting a specific type of
        light profile is desired.

        There is a noteable reason why a different `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList` object is created for each
        galaxy. In the project PyAutoLens, an inversion is performed on a strong lens, consisting of a lens galaxy
        and source galaxy whose grids are different (the source-plane grid is deflected by the lens galaxy).

        In this case, because each `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList` object is associated with a different galaxy
        it is also associated with a different grid. Users of PyAutoLens should therefore be aware that in
        the `lens.to_inversion` module multiple `GalaxiesToInversion` objects are used to setup the inversion in this
        way.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cls
            The class of the light profiles which are extracted from the galaxies, which is
            typically `LightProfileLinear` or `Basis`.

        and for each galaxy grouping them into a `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList` object, which is associated with the
        galaxy via the dictionary. It also extracts linear light profiles from `Basis` objects and makes this

        This function first creates a dictionary of linear light profiles associated with each galaxy, and then

        Returns a list of image-plane mesh-grids, which are image-plane grids defining the centres of the pixels of

        The `image_mesh` attribute of the pixelization object defines whether the centre of each mesh pixel are
        determined in the image-plane. When this is the case, the pixelization therefore has an image-plane mesh-grid,
        which needs to be computed before the inversion is performed.

        This function iterates over all galaxies with pixelizations, determines which pixelizations have an

        It returns a list of all image-plane mesh-grids, which in the functions `mapper_from` and `mapper_galaxy_dict`
        are grouped into a `Mapper` object with other information required to perform the inversion using the
        pixelization.

        The order of this list is not important, because the `linear_obj_galaxy_dict` function associates each
        mapper object (and therefore image-plane mesh-grid) with the galaxy it belongs to and is therefore used
        elsewhere in the code (e.g. the fit module) to match inversion results to galaxies.

        Certain image meshes adapt their pixels to the dataset, for example congregating the pixels to the brightest
        regions of the image. This requires that `adapt_images` are used when setting up the image-plane mesh-grid.

        """
        Returns a `Mapper` object from the attributes required to create one, which are extracted and computed
        from the dataset and galaxies.

        The `Mapper` object is used by a pixelization to perform an inversion. It maps pixels from the dataset's
        `data` to the pixels of the `mesh` which reconstruct the data via the inversion. These mappings are used to
        construct the `mapping_matrix` and other linear algebra matrices used in the inversion.

        This function is quite complex due to requirements from the child project PyAutoLens. In PyAutoLens, the
        `Mapper` object has grids corresponding to both the image-plane (e.g. the pixels of the dataset) and the
        source-plane (e.g. after gravitational lensing). There are also separate grids for the data and mesh pixels.
        In total, this means there are four grids: `image_plane_data_grid`, `image_plane_mesh_grid`,
        `source_plane_data_grid` and `source_plane_mesh_grid`. Lensing calculations are performed before these
        grids are passed  to this function.

        In PyAutoGalaxy, there is no lensing and therefore the `image_plane_data_grid` and `source_plane_data_grid`
        are identical, as are the `image_plane_mesh_grid` and `source_plane_mesh_grid`. This function therefore has
        an overly complex API, as it is designed to support PyAutoLens's use-cases.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mesh
            The mesh of the pixelization, which defines the pixels used to reconstruct the data (e.g. `Voronoi`).
        regularization
            The regularization scheme used to regularize the mesh pixel's reconstructed fluxes.
        source_plane_mesh_grid
            The mesh-grid of the source-plane which reconstructs the data (e.g. the centre of the `Voronoi` cells
            after lensing). In PyAutoGalaxy, this is identical to the `image_plane_mesh_grid`.
        source_plane_data_grid
            The data-grid of the source-plane, which are the ray-traced coordinates of the image-plane pixels
            that align with the image data. In PyAutoGalaxy, this is identical to the `image_plane_data_grid`.
        adapt_galaxy_image
            Images which certain pixelizations use to adapt their properties to the dataset, for example congregating
            the pixelization's pixels to the brightest regions of the image.
        image_plane_mesh_grid
            The mesh-grid of the image-plane, which are the centres of the pixels of the dataset. This is only required
            if the pixelization has an `image_mesh` attribute.

        Returns
        -------
        A `Mapper` object which maps the dataset's data to the pixelization's mesh.

        Returns a dictionary associating each `Mapper` object with the galaxy it belongs to.

        The docstring of the function `mapper_from` describes the `Mapper` object in detail, and is used
        in this function to create the `Mapper` objects which are associated with the galaxies.

        In brief, the `Mappers` are used by pixelizations to perform an inversion. They map pixels from the dataset's
        `data` to the pixels of the `mesh` which reconstruct the data via the inversion. These mappings are used to
        construct the `mapping_matrix` and other linear algebra matrices used in the inversion.

        This function essentially finds all galaxies with pixelizations, performs all necessary calculations to
        set up the `Mapper` objects (e.g. compute the `image_plane_mesh_grid`), and then associates each `Mapper`
        with the galaxy it belongs to.
