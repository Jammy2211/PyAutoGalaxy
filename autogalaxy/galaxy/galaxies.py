        A collection of galaxies, used to perform operations on the galaxies as a group.

        It is common for a user to have multiple galaxies in a list, for which they may perform operations like
        creating the image of the light profiles or all galaxies or the potential of the mass profiles of all galaxies.

        Many of these calculations are straight forward, for example for the image of all galaxies we simply sum the
        images of each galaxy.

        However, there are more complex operations that can be performed on the galaxies as a group, for example
        computing the blured image of a group of galaxies where some galaxies have operated light profiles (meaning
        that PSF blurring is already applied to them and thus should be skipped) and another subset of galaxies have
        normal light profiles (meaning that PSF blurring should be applied to them).

        This calculation requires a careful set of operations to ensure that the PSF blurring is only applied to the
        subset of galaxies that do not have operated light profiles. This is an example of a calculation that is
        performed by the `Galaxies` class, simplifing the code required to perform this operation.

        Users may find that they often omit the `Galaxies` class and instead perform these operations in a more manual
        way. This is fine, but care must be taken to ensure that the operations are performed correctly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        galaxies
            The list of galaxies whose calculations are performed by this class.
        run_time_dict

            different calculations.

        """
        Returns a list of the 2D images for each galaxy from a 2D grid of Cartesian (y,x) coordinates.

        The image of each galaxy is computed by summing the images of all light profiles in that galaxy. If a galaxy
        has no light profiles, a numpy array of zeros is returned.

        For example, if there are 3 galaxies and only the first two have light profiles, the returned list of images
        will be the image of the first two galaxies. The image of the third galaxies will be a numpy array of zeros.

        The images output by this function do not include instrument operations, such as PSF convolution (for imaging
        data) or a Fourier transform (for interferometer data).

        Inherited methods in the `autogalaxy.operate.image` package can apply these operations to the images.
        These functions may have the `operated_only` input passed to them, which is why this function includes
        the `operated_only` input.

        If the `operated_only` input is included, the function omits light profiles which are parents of
        the `LightProfileOperated` object, which signifies that the light profile represents emission that has
        already had the instrument operations (e.g. PSF convolution, a Fourier transform) applied to it and therefore
        that operation is not performed again.

        See the `autogalaxy.profiles.light` package for details of how images are computed from a light
        profile.

        Parameters

            (e.g. via the imaging PSF). However, inherited methods in the `autogalaxy.operate.image` package can
            apply these operations to the images, which may have the `operated_only` input passed to them. This input
            therefore is used to pass the `operated_only` input to these methods.
