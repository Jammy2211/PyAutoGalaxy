        Returns all radial caustics of the lensing system, which are computed as follows:

        1) Compute the radial eigen values for every coordinate on the input grid via the Jacobian.
        2) Find contours of all values in the radial eigen values that are zero using a marching squares algorithm.
        3) Compute the lensing system's deflection angles at the (y,x) coordinates of the radial critical curve
