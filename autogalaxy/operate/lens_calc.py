"""
`LensCalc` — a calculator that derives all secondary lensing quantities from a deflection callable.

Given any object that exposes `deflections_yx_2d_from` (a `MassProfile`, `Galaxy`, `Galaxies`, or
`Tracer`), `LensCalc` computes:

- **Hessian** (four components: H_yy, H_xy, H_yx, H_xx) — the matrix of second derivatives of the
  lensing potential, computed by finite differences (NumPy) or automatic differentiation (JAX).
- **Convergence via Hessian** — κ = 0.5 (H_yy + H_xx), independent of the analytic profile formula.
- **Shear** — γ₁ = 0.5 (H_xx − H_yy), γ₂ = H_xy.
- **Magnification** — μ = 1 / det(I − H).
- **Critical curves** — image-plane loci where det(I − H) = 0, found via marching squares.
- **Caustics** — source-plane images of the critical curves.
- **Einstein radius** — the effective radius from the area enclosed by the tangential critical curve.
- **Fermat potential** — φ(θ) = ½|θ − β|² − ψ(θ), using the optional potential callable.

The class is constructed with `LensCalc.from_mass_obj(mass)` or `LensCalc.from_tracer(tracer)`.

        The Hessian is returned as a 4-entry tuple reflecting its structure as a 2x2 matrix:
        (hessian_yy, hessian_xy, hessian_yx, hessian_xx).

        Two computational paths are available, selected via the `xp` parameter:

        - **NumPy** (``xp=np``, default): 2-point central finite-difference approximation,
          Richardson-extrapolated at step sizes ``h`` and ``h/2`` and combined as
          ``(4 * H(h/2) - H(h)) / 3``. This cancels the leading ``O(h^2)`` truncation term,
          giving ``O(h^4)`` accuracy. JAX is not imported.

          The step is **adaptive per grid point**, and convergence is judged on the change
          between **successive** extrapolants: ``R_k`` from the pair ``(h_k, h_k/2)`` and
          ``R_{k+1}`` from ``(h_k/2, h_k/4)``, which costs one new finite-difference evaluation
          because the half-step evaluation is reused. A point stops refining on either of two
          rules:

          1. **Tolerance** -- all four Hessian components satisfy
             ``|R_{k+1} - R_k| <= atol + rtol * |R_{k+1}|`` (defaults ``rtol=1e-7``,
             ``atol=1e-8``). ``R_{k+1}`` is returned.
          2. **Roundoff floor** -- the change has stopped shrinking (``|R_{k+1} - R_k|`` is
             larger, relatively, than ``|R_k - R_{k-1}|``) while already below
             ``roundoff_guard=1e-4`` relative. Halving further only feeds cancellation error, so
             ``R_k``, the estimate from before the growth, is returned. This is what keeps a
             configuration whose deflections are themselves evaluated numerically (a multi-plane
             trace, say, which can floor at ~3e-8 relative) from warning on every call.

          Neither rule warns. Points that reach ``max_halvings=20`` halvings while their change
          is still shrinking -- a genuine singularity, e.g. a grid point exactly on an isothermal
          centre, whose relative change never falls below the guard -- keep their final
          extrapolant and trigger a single ``UserWarning`` reporting how many points did not
          converge. Nothing is ever silently returned as converged, and no exception is raised.

          A smooth field settles after three finite-difference evaluations; only points near
          compact structure, where a fixed 0.01" step is far too coarse, iterate further.

        - **JAX** (``xp=jnp``): exact derivatives via ``jax.jacfwd`` applied to
          ``deflections_yx_scalar``, vectorised over the grid with ``jnp.vectorize``.

        Both paths support uniform ``Grid2D`` and irregular ``Grid2DIrregular`` grids.

        ``R = (4 H(h/2) - H(h)) / 3``, which cancels the leading ``O(h^2)`` truncation term. The
        fixed-step implementation returned the first such ``R`` whatever the field looked like.
        Here the step keeps halving and each point stops on one of two rules, neither of which
        warns:

        1. **Tolerance.** ``R_k`` from ``(h_k, h_k/2)`` and ``R_{k+1}`` from ``(h_k/2, h_k/4)``
           agree on all four components: ``|R_{k+1} - R_k| <= atol + rtol * |R_{k+1}|``.
           ``R_{k+1}`` is kept.
        2. **Roundoff floor.** The relative change grew instead of shrinking, while already
           below ``roundoff_guard``. Finite differences fall as ``O(h^2)`` only until
           cancellation in ``(f(x+h) - f(x-h))`` takes over, after which halving makes the answer
           *worse*; the turning point is the best the arithmetic can do. ``R_k``, the estimate
           from before the growth, is kept.

        Because the half-step evaluation is reused as the next full-step one, each halving costs a
        single finite-difference evaluation, and only on the shrinking active subset.

        Judging on the extrapolants rather than on a pair's own error estimate
        ``|H(h/2) - H(h)| / 3`` matters: that estimate bounds the error of ``H(h/2)``, which is
        ``O(h^2)``, not of ``R``, which is ``O(h^4)``, so it declares non-convergence orders of
        magnitude past the point where the returned value has stopped moving.

        Rule 2 is guarded by ``roundoff_guard`` so that it cannot silence a genuine singularity:
        a grid point sitting exactly on an isothermal centre has a relative change that stays at
        ~0.5 forever, never entering the guard band, so it runs to ``max_halvings``, keeps its
        last extrapolant and raises a single ``UserWarning``. It is never silently accepted, and
        no exception is raised (a raise here would kill an otherwise-converged model fit).

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid
            The 2D grid of (y,x) arc-second coordinates the Hessian is computed on.
        buffer
            The initial finite-difference step size in arc-seconds.
        rtol
            The relative tolerance the change between successive extrapolants must meet.
        atol
            The absolute tolerance the change between successive extrapolants must meet.
        max_halvings
            The maximum number of times the step is halved before points that are still refining
            are warned about and their last value kept.
        roundoff_guard
            The relative change below which a growing change is read as the roundoff floor rather
            than as a field the step has not resolved yet.

        Returns the lensing Jacobian of the lensing object as a 2x2 list of lists.

        The Jacobian is the matrix `A = I - H`, where `H` is the Hessian matrix of the

        ``A = [[1 - hessian_xx, -hessian_xy], [-hessian_yx, 1 - hessian_yy]]``

        It is computed from `hessian_from`, so it supports both uniform and irregular

        **Row/column convention**: the returned 2x2 list is in **(x, y)** row/column order

        Returns the 2D weak-lensing shear vector field of the lensing object, computed from the deflection-angle

        .. math::

        where :math:`\psi(\theta)` is the lensing potential and :math:`H_{ij}` are its second partial derivatives,
        i.e. the components of the Hessian returned by ``hessian_from``.  The two components together encode the
        full distortion tensor of a background source: :math:`\gamma_1` is the stretch along the x/y axes and
        :math:`\gamma_2` is the stretch along the diagonals.

        Because the Hessian is computed numerically (Richardson-extrapolated finite differences in NumPy, or
        ``jax.jacfwd`` in JAX), this routine works for **any** ``MassProfile``, ``Galaxy``, ``Galaxies`` or
        ``Tracer`` that exposes ``deflections_yx_2d_from`` — no per-profile analytic formula is required.  It can
        therefore be used as a numerical cross-check of analytic shear methods such as
        ``Isothermal.shear_yx_2d_from`` (see ``test_isothermal.py``).  It also accepts both uniform ``Grid2D`` and
        irregular ``Grid2DIrregular`` grids, which makes it the natural choice for simulating a weak-lensing
        shear field on either a regular pixel grid or at the discrete positions of background source galaxies.

        Convention
        ----------
        The result is returned as a ``ShearYX2DIrregular`` data structure of shape ``[total_shear_vectors, 2]``,
        where:

        - ``[:, 0]`` are the :math:`\gamma_2` values
        - ``[:, 1]`` are the :math:`\gamma_1` values

        Note therefore that the FIRST column is :math:`\gamma_2` and the SECOND column is :math:`\gamma_1`.  This
        ordering matches the ``[y, x]`` ordering used elsewhere in the project for vector fields, since
        :math:`\gamma_2` plays the role of the "y" component and :math:`\gamma_1` the "x" component when the shear
        field is treated as a 2D pseudo-vector.

        control flow over concrete array values and cannot be traced, so it is

        The eigen value is computed from the raw Hessian tuple returned by
        ``hessian_from`` rather than through ``tangential_eigen_value_from``,
        because the latter returns an ``aa.Array2D`` under NumPy and a raw array
        under ``jax.numpy``; the raw-Hessian route is ``xp``-generic in one body.
        The shear terms are symmetrised exactly as in ``_make_eigen_fn``.

        Cells whose eigen value is not finite are masked out before the argmin.
        The default ``25 x 25`` grid has an odd shape, so one cell sits exactly on
        the origin, where an isothermal centre is singular; without the mask the
        argmin would follow that NaN instead of the critical curve.

        Limitations
        -----------
        Exactly **one** seed is returned -- the global minimum of
        ``|eigen value|`` over the coarse grid. A model with several distinct
        tangential critical curves (a cluster-scale lens, a multi-component
        deflector) will therefore be seeded on only one of them. Callers with
        such models should pass ``init_guess`` explicitly.

        Cost is ``grid_shape[0] * grid_shape[1]`` Hessian evaluations (625 by
        default), which is negligible next to the contour trace that follows.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kind
            ``"tangential"`` (eigen value = ``1 - kappa - |gamma|``) or
            ``"radial"`` (``1 - kappa + |gamma|``).
        grid_shape
            Number of pixels along each axis of the coarse evaluation grid.
        grid_extent
            Half-width of the coarse grid in arc-seconds. This is the knob for
            off-centre or cluster-scale lenses: the critical curve must fall
            inside the grid for the argmin to find it.
        pixel_scales
            Accepted for signature symmetry with ``einstein_radius_jit_from``,
            but **not used**: the JAX Hessian path takes its pixel scales from
            the coarse grid itself (``_hessian_via_jax`` reads
            ``grid.pixel_scales``), and the NumPy path uses finite differences
            with its own adaptive step.
        xp

        Returns tangential critical curves using the ``jax_zero_contour`` package.

        Unlike ``tangential_critical_curve_list_from``, this method does not
        evaluate lensing quantities on a dense uniform grid.  Instead it traces
        the zero contour of the tangential eigen value directly, evaluating the
        function only along the curve itself.

        The algorithm (from ``jax_zero_contour.ZeroSolver``):

        1. Newton's method projects each initial guess onto the exact zero
           contour of the tangential eigen value.
        2. Euler-Lagrange (gradient-perpendicular) stepping traces the contour
           in both directions from each projected seed point.
        3. Tracing stops when the path closes, hits an endpoint, or exhausts
           ``N`` steps.

        Parameters
        ----------
        init_guess
            JAX or NumPy array of shape ``(n, 2)`` with rough ``(y, x)``
            positions near the tangential critical curve — one seed per
            distinct curve.  If ``None`` a coarse 25 × 25 grid scan is used
            to find seed points automatically.
        delta
            Arc-second step size along the contour.  Smaller values give
            denser, more accurate curves but require a larger ``N`` to trace
            the same total length.
        N
            Maximum number of steps in each direction from each seed point.
            The traced path has at most ``2N + 1`` points per seed.
        pixel_scales
            Pixel scales passed to ``deflections_yx_scalar`` for its internal
            single-pixel mask.
        tol
            Newton's method convergence tolerance (forwarded to ``ZeroSolver``).

        JIT-friendly Einstein radius from the tangential critical curve.

        Designed for use inside ``jax.jit(...)`` (e.g. the per-sample latent
        loop in ``autofit.Analysis.compute_latent_samples`` with
        ``LATENT_BATCH_MODE='jit'``). Unlike ``einstein_radius_via_zero_contour_from``,
        this method:

        - Finds its own Newton seed inside the trace when ``init_guess`` is not
          given: the eigen value is evaluated on a coarse
          ``seed_grid_shape`` grid of half-width ``seed_grid_extent`` arc-seconds
          and the cell with the smallest ``|tangential eigen value|`` is taken as
          the seed (``_seed_via_coarse_grid_argmin``). No ``skimage``, no
          marching squares, and no Python control flow on traced values — unlike
          ``_init_guess_from_coarse_grid``, which cannot be traced. The seed
          search returns a **single** seed (the global minimum), so a model with
          several distinct tangential critical curves is seeded on only one of
          them; pass ``init_guess`` explicitly for those. It costs
          ``seed_grid_shape[0] * seed_grid_shape[1]`` ``jacfwd`` Hessian
          evaluations (625 by default), negligible next to the contour trace.
        - Skips ``ZeroSolver.path_reduce`` (variable-length output, not jit-able).
        - Computes the enclosed area directly from the raw NaN-padded paths
          array via a JAX-vectorised shoelace formula.
        - Returns a single scalar ``jax.Array`` (not a Python ``float``).

        Do NOT combine this with ``jax.vmap`` — the underlying
        ``jax_zero_contour.ZeroSolver.zero_contour_finder`` uses
        ``jax.lax.cond`` / ``jax.lax.while_loop`` for early termination, which
        upstream explicitly documents as incompatible with ``jax.vmap``. For
        batched evaluation, wrap the caller in ``jax.jit`` and loop over
        samples in Python (see ``Analysis.LATENT_BATCH_MODE='jit'``).

        Parameters
        ----------
        init_guess
            Optional JAX or NumPy array of shape ``(n_seeds, 2)`` — seed
            positions (y, x) near the expected critical curve. ``None`` (the
            default) runs the in-trace coarse-grid argmin seed search described
            above, which is correct for any single-critical-curve model whose
            curve falls inside ``seed_grid_extent``. Pass seeds explicitly for a
            model with several distinct tangential critical curves (e.g. four at
            cardinal positions), which the single-seed search cannot cover.
        delta
            Arc-second step size along the contour. Forwarded to ``ZeroSolver``.
        N
            Maximum steps per seed direction. Forwarded to ``ZeroSolver``.
        pixel_scales
            Pixel scales passed to ``deflections_yx_scalar`` (used internally
            by ``_make_eigen_fn``).
        tol
            Newton's method convergence tolerance.
        max_newton
            Maximum Newton iterations per step.
        seed_grid_shape
            Number of pixels along each axis of the coarse grid used by the
            in-trace seed search. Ignored when ``init_guess`` is given.
        seed_grid_extent
            Half-width in arc-seconds of that coarse grid. This is the knob for
            off-centre or cluster-scale lenses: the critical curve must fall
            inside the grid for the argmin to find it (the default ±3" covers a
            galaxy-scale lens centred near the origin). Ignored when
            ``init_guess`` is given.

        Returns
        -------
        jax.Array
            Scalar Einstein radius in arc-seconds (``sqrt(area / pi)`` where
            ``area`` is the largest enclosed area across all seeds — robust
            to multiple seeds landing on the same critical curve).
