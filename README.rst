Getting Started
---------------

The following links are useful for new starters:

- `The PyAutoGalaxy readthedocs <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_, which includes `an overview of PyAutoGalaxy's core features <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/overview_1_start_here.html>`_, `a new user starting guide <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/overview_2_new_user_guide.html>`_ and `an installation guide <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/overview.html>`_.

- `The introduction Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/PyAutoLabs/autogalaxy_workspace/blob/2026.5.1.1/start_here.ipynb>`_, where you can try **PyAutoGalaxy** in a web browser (without installation).

- `The autogalaxy_workspace GitHub repository <https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autogalaxy_workspace>`_: example scripts covering every **PyAutoGalaxy** use case.

- `The HowToGalaxy GitHub repository <https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/HowToGalaxy>`_: a Jupyter notebook lecture series teaching galaxy modeling from the ground up.

Core Aims
---------

**PyAutoGalaxy** has three core aims:

- **Big Data**: Scaling automated Sérsic fitting to extremely large datasets, *accelerated with JAX on GPUs and using tools like an SQL database to **build a scalable scientific workflow***.

- **Model Complexity**: Fitting complex galaxy morphology models (e.g. Multi Gaussian Expansion, Shapelets, Ellipse Fitting, Irregular Meshes) that go beyond just simple Sérsic fitting.

- **Data Variety**: Support for many data types (e.g. CCD imaging, interferometry, multi-band imaging) which can be fitted independently or simultaneously.

A complete overview of the software's aims is provided in our `Journal of Open Source Software paper <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04475>`_.

Community & Support
-------------------

Support for **PyAutoGalaxy** is available via our Slack workspace, where the community shares updates, discusses
galaxy modeling and analysis, and helps troubleshoot problems.

Slack is invitation-only. If you’d like to join, please send an email requesting an invite.

For installation issues, bug reports, or feature requests, please raise an issue on the `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/issues>`_.

HowToGalaxy
-----------

For users less familiar with galaxy analysis, Bayesian inference, and scientific analysis, you may wish to read through
the **HowToGalaxy** lectures. These introduce the basic principles of galaxy modeling and Bayesian inference, with
the material pitched at undergraduate level and above.

A complete overview of the lectures `is provided on the HowToGalaxy readthedocs page <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtogalaxy/howtogalaxy.html>`_, and the notebooks themselves live in the `PyAutoLabs/HowToGalaxy <https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/HowToGalaxy>`_ repository.
