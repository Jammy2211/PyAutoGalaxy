**PyAutoGalaxy** has three core aims:

- **Big Data**: Scaling automated Sérsic fitting to extremely large datasets, *accelerated with JAX on GPUs and using tools like an SQL database to **build a scalable scientific workflow***.

- **Model Complexity**: Fitting complex galaxy morphology models (e.g. Multi Gaussian Expansion, Shapelets, Ellipse Fitting, Irregular Meshes) that go beyond just simple Sérsic fitting.

- **Data Variety**: Support for many data types (e.g. CCD imaging, interferometry, multi-band imaging) which can be fitted independently or simultaneously.

This overview gives an overview of **PyAutoGalaxy**'s API, core features and details of the autogalaxy_workspace.

Imports
-------

Lets first import autogalaxy, its plotting module and the other libraries we'll need.

You'll see these imports in the majority of workspace examples.

.. code:: python

    import autogalaxy as ag
    import autogalaxy.plot as aplt

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from os import path

Lets illustrate a simple galaxy structure calculations creating an an image of a galaxy using a light profile.

Grid
----

The emission of light from a galaxy is described using the ``Grid2D`` data structure, which is two-dimensional
Cartesian grids of (y,x) coordinates where the light profile of the galaxy is evaluated on the grid.

We make and plot a uniform Cartesian grid:

.. code:: python

    grid = ag.Grid2D.uniform(
        shape_native=(150, 150),  # The [pixels x pixels] shape of the grid in 2D.
        pixel_scales=0.05,  # The pixel-scale describes the conversion from pixel units to arc-seconds.
    )

    grid_plotter = aplt.Grid2DPlotter(grid=grid)
    grid_plotter.figure_2d()

The ``Grid2D`` looks like this:

Light Profiles
--------------

Our aim is to create an image of the morphological structures that make up a galaxy.

This uses analytic functions representing a galaxy's light, referred to as ``LightProfile`` objects. 

The most common light profile in Astronomy is the elliptical Sersic, which we create an instance of below:

.. code:: python

    sersic_light_profile = ag.lp.Sersic(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),  # The light profile centre [units of arc-seconds].
        ell_comps=(
            0.2,
            0.1,
        ),  # The light profile elliptical components [can be converted to axis-ratio and position angle].
        intensity=0.005,  # The overall intensity normalisation [units arbitrary and are matched to the data].
        effective_radius=2.0,  # The effective radius containing half the profile's total luminosity [units of arc-seconds].
        sersic_index=4.0,  # Describes the profile's shape [higher value -> more concentrated profile].
    )

By passing the light profile the ``grid``, we evaluate the light emitted at every (y,x) coordinate and therefore create 
an image of the Sersic light profile.

.. code:: python

    image = sersic_light_profile.image_2d_from(grid=grid)

Plotting
--------

In-built plotting methods are provided for plotting objects and their properties, like the image of
a light profile we just created.

By using a ``LightProfilePlotter`` to plot the light profile's image, the figured is improved. 

Its axis units are scaled to arc-seconds, a color-bar is added, its given a descriptive labels, etc.

The plot module is highly customizable and designed to make it straight forward to create clean and informative figures
for fits to large datasets.

.. code:: python

    light_profile_plotter = aplt.LightProfilePlotter(
        light_profile=sersic_light_profile, grid=grid
    )
    light_profile_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

The light profile appears as follows:

  :width: 600

Galaxy
------

A ``Galaxy`` object is a collection of light profiles at a specific redshift.

This object is highly extensible and is what ultimately allows us to fit complex models to galaxy images.

Below, we combine the Sersic light profile above with an Exponential light profile to create a galaxy containing both
a bulge and disk component.

.. code:: python

    exponential_light_profile = ag.lp.Exponential(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0), ell_comps=(0.1, 0.0), intensity=0.1, effective_radius=0.5
    )

    galaxy = ag.Galaxy(
        redshift=0.5, bulge=sersic_light_profile, disk=exponential_light_profile
    )


The ``GalaxyPlotter`` object plots the image of the galaxy, which is the sum of its bulge and disk light profiles.

.. code:: python

    galaxy_plotter = aplt.GalaxyPlotter(galaxy=galaxy, grid=grid)
    galaxy_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

The galaxy, with both a bulge and disk, appears as follows:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/main/docs/overview/images/overview_1/2_image_2d.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

One example of the plotter's customizability is the ability to plot the individual light profiles of the galaxy
on a subplot.

.. code:: python

    galaxy_plotter.subplot_of_light_profiles(image=True)

The light profiles appear as follows:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/main/docs/overview/images/overview_1/3_subplot_image.png

Galaxies
--------

The ``Galaxies`` object is a collection of galaxies at the same redshift.

In a moment, we will see it is integral to the model-fitting API. 

For now, lets use it to create an image of a pair of merging galaxies, noting that a more concise API for creating
the galaxy is used below where the ``Sersic`` is passed directly to the ``Galaxy`` object.

.. code:: python

    galaxy_1 = ag.Galaxy(
        redshift=0.5,
        bulge=ag.lp.Sersic(
            centre=(0.5, 0.2), intensity=1.0, effective_radius=1.0, sersic_index=2.0
        ),
    )

    galaxies = ag.Galaxies(
        galaxies=[galaxy, galaxy_1],
    )

    galaxies_plotter = aplt.GalaxiesPlotter(galaxies=galaxies, grid=grid)
    galaxies_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/main/docs/overview/images/overview_1/4_image_2d.png
  :width: 600

Units
-----

The units used throughout the galaxy structure literature vary, therefore lets quickly describe the units used in
**PyAutoGalaxy**.

Most distance quantities, like an ``effective_radius`` are quantities in terms of angles, which are defined in units
of arc-seconds. To convert these to physical units (e.g. kiloparsecs), we use the redshift of the galaxy and an
input cosmology. A run through of all normal unit conversions is given in guides in the workspace outlined below.

The use of angles in arc-seconds has an important property, it means that calculations are independent of
the galaxy's redshifts and the input cosmology. This has a number of benefits, for example it makes it straight
forward to compare the properties of different galaxies even when the redshifts of the galaxies are unknown.

Extensibility
-------------

All of the objects we've introduced so far are highly extensible, for example a galaxy can be made up of any number of
light profiles and many galaxy objects can be combined into a galaxies object.

To further illustrate this, we create a merging galaxy system with 4 star forming clumps of light, using a 
``SersicSph`` profile to make each spherical.

.. code:: python

    galaxy_0 = ag.Galaxy(
        redshift=0.5,
        bulge=ag.lp.Sersic(
            centre=(0.0, 0.0),
            ell_comps=ag.convert.ell_comps_from(axis_ratio=0.9, angle=45.0),
            intensity=0.2,
            effective_radius=0.8,
            sersic_index=4.0,
        ),
        disk=ag.lp.Exponential(
            centre=(0.0, 0.0),
            ell_comps=ag.convert.ell_comps_from(axis_ratio=0.7, angle=30.0),
            intensity=0.1,
            effective_radius=1.6,
        ),
        extra_galaxy_0=ag.lp.SersicSph(centre=(1.0, 1.0), intensity=0.5, effective_radius=0.2),
        extra_galaxy_1=ag.lp.SersicSph(centre=(0.5, 0.8), intensity=0.5, effective_radius=0.2),
        extra_galaxy_2=ag.lp.SersicSph(centre=(-1.0, -0.7), intensity=0.5, effective_radius=0.2),
        extra_galaxy_3=ag.lp.SersicSph(centre=(-1.0, 0.4), intensity=0.5, effective_radius=0.2),
    )

    galaxy_1 = ag.Galaxy(
        redshift=0.5,
        bulge=ag.lp.Sersic(
            centre=(0.0, 1.0),
            ell_comps=(0.0, 0.1),
            intensity=0.1,
            effective_radius=0.6,
            sersic_index=3.0,
        ),
    )

    galaxies = ag.Galaxies(galaxies=[galaxy_0, galaxy_1])

    galaxies_plotter = aplt.GalaxiesPlotter(galaxies=galaxies, grid=grid)
    galaxies_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

The image of the merging galaxy system appears as follows:

Galaxy Modeling
---------------

Galaxy modeling is the process of fitting a physical model to imaging data in order to infer the structural
and photometric properties of galaxies, such as their light distribution, size, shape, and orientation.

The primary goal of **PyAutoGalaxy** is to make galaxy modeling **simple, scalable to large datasets, and fast**,
with GPU acceleration provided via JAX.

The animation below illustrates the galaxy modeling workflow. Many models are fitted to the data iteratively,
progressively improving the quality of the fit until the model closely reproduces the observed image.

NOTE: Placeholder showing strong lens modeling animation used currently.

The next documentation page guides you through galaxy modeling for a variety of data types (e.g. CCD imaging at
different resolutions) and scientific use-cases (e.g. galaxy morphology studies, bulge–disk decomposition).

Simulations
-----------

Simulating galaxy images is often essential, for example to:

- Practice galaxy modeling before working with real data.
- Generate large training sets (e.g. for machine learning).
- Test galaxy formation and structural models in a fully controlled environment.

The next documentation page guides you through how to simulate galaxies for different types of data
(e.g. CCD imaging) and different modeling goals (e.g. single-component galaxies, multi-component systems).


Wrap Up
-------

This completes the introduction to **PyAutoGalaxy**, including a brief overview of the core API for galaxy
light profile calculations, galaxy modeling, and data simulation.

Different users will be interested in galaxies across a range of physical scales and scientific applications
(e.g. detailed structural studies, population analyses, or multi-wavelength modeling) and using different
types of data (e.g. CCD imaging or interferometer observations).

The autogalaxy_workspace repository contains a wide range of examples and tutorials covering these use cases.
The next documentation page helps new users identify the most appropriate starting point based on their
scientific goals.
