2D Data Structures
------------------

Two-dimensional data structures store and mask 2D arrays containing data (e.g. images) and
grids of (y,x) Cartesian coordinates (which are used for evaluating light profiles).

   Mask2D
   Array2D
   Grid2D
   Grid2DIrregular

Imaging
-------

For datasets taken with a CCD (or similar imaging device), including objects which perform
2D convolution.

Interferometer
--------------

For datasets taken with an interferometer (E.g. ALMA), including objects which perform
a fast Fourier transform to map data to the uv-plane.

Over Sampling
-------------

Calculations using grids approximate a 2D line integral of the light in the galaxy which falls in each image-pixel.
Different over sampling schemes can be used to efficiently approximate this integral and these objects can be
applied to datasets to apply over sampling to their fit.

1D Data Structures
------------------

One-dimensional data structures store and mask 1D arrays and grids of (x) Cartesian
coordinates.

Their most common use is manipulating 1D representations of a light profile (e.g. computing
the intensity versus radius in 1D).
