Installation with conda
=======================

Install
-------

Installation via a conda environment circumvents compatibility issues when installing certain libraries. This guide
assumes you have a working installation of `conda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.

First, update conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda update -n base -c defaults conda

Next, create a conda environment (we name this ``autogalaxy`` to signify it is for the **PyAutoGalaxy** install):

The command below creates this environment with Python 3.12:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n autogalaxy python=3.12

Activate the conda environment (you will have to do this every time you want to run **PyAutoGalaxy**):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate autogalaxy

We upgrade pip to ensure certain libraries install:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip

The latest version of **PyAutoGalaxy** is installed via pip as follows (the command ``--no-cache-dir`` prevents
caching issues impacting the installation):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install autogalaxy --no-cache-dir

If pip prints warnings about dependency version conflicts, these can usually be ignored — the instructions below
will identify clearly if the installation is a success.

If there are no errors **PyAutoGalaxy** is installed!

If there is an error check out the `troubleshooting section <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/troubleshooting.html>`_.

Workspace
---------

Next, clone the ``autogalaxy workspace`` (the line ``--depth 1`` clones only the most recent branch on
the ``autogalaxy_workspace``, reducing the download size):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/on/your/computer/you/want/to/put/the/autogalaxy_workspace
   git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/autogalaxy_workspace --depth 1
   cd autogalaxy_workspace

Run the ``welcome.py`` script to get started!

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 welcome.py

It should be clear that **PyAutoGalaxy** runs without issue.

If there is an error check out the `troubleshooting section <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/troubleshooting.html>`_.

Numba
-----

Numba (https://numba.pydata.org)  is an optional library which makes **PyAutoGalaxy** run a lot faster, which we
strongly recommend users have installed.

You can install numba via the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numba --no-cache-dir

Some users have experienced difficulties installing numba, which is why it is an optional library. If your
installation is not successful, you can use **PyAutoGalaxy** without it installed for now, to familiarize yourself
with the software and determine if it is the right software for you.

If you decide that **PyAutoGalaxy** is the right software, then I recommend you commit the time to getting a
successful numba install working, with more information provided `at this readthedocs page <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/numba.html>`_

Optional
--------

For interferometer analysis there are two optional dependencies that must be installed via the commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pynufft

**PyAutoGalaxy** will run without these libraries and it is recommended that you only install them if you intend to
do interferometer analysis.

If you run interferometer code a message explaining that you need to install these libraries will be printed, therefore
it is safe not to install them initially.
