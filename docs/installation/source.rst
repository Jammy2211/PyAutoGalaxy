Building From Source
====================

Building from source means that you clone (or fork) the **PyAutoGalaxy** GitHub repository and run **PyAutoGalaxy** from
there. Unlike ``conda`` and ``pip`` this provides a build of the source code that you can edit and change, to
contribute the development **PyAutoGalaxy** or experiment with yourself!

A large amount of **PyAutoGalaxy** functionality is contained in its parent projects:

**PyAutoFit** https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit

**PyAutoArray** https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoArray

If you wish to build from source all code you may need to build from source these 3 additional
projects. We include below instructions for building just **PyAutoGalaxy** from source or building all projects.

Building Only PyAutoGalaxy
--------------------------

We upgrade pip to ensure certain libraries install:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip

First, clone (or fork) the **PyAutoGalaxy** GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy

Next, install the **PyAuto** parent projects via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install autoconf
   pip install autofit
   pip install autoarray

Next, install the **PyAutoGalaxy** dependencies via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r PyAutoGalaxy/requirements.txt

Next, install the optional dependency numba via pip (see `this link <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/numba.html>`_ for a description of numba):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numba

For unit tests to pass you will also need the following optional requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pynufft
    pip install pylops==1.11.1

If you are using a ``conda`` environment, add the source repository as follows:

[NOTE: Certain versions of conda use the command ``conda develop`` (without a dash) instead of those shown below.]

.. code-block:: bash

   conda-develop PyAutoGalaxy

Alternatively, if you are using a Python environment include the **PyAutoGalaxy** source repository in your PYTHONPATH
(noting that you must replace the text ``/path/to`` with the path to the **PyAutoGalaxy** directory on your computer):

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoGalaxy

Finally, check the **PyAutoGalaxy** unit tests run and pass (you may need to install pytest via ``pip install pytest``):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/PyAutoGalaxy
   python3 -m pytest


Building All Projects
---------------------

We upgrade pip to ensure certain libraries install:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip

First, clone (or fork) all 4 GitHub repositories:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit
    git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoArray
    git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy

Next, install **PyAutoConf** via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install autoconf

Next, install the source build dependencies of each project via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r PyAutoFit/requirements.txt
   pip install -r PyAutoArray/requirements.txt
   pip install -r PyAutoGalaxy/requirements.txt

Next, install the optional dependency numba via pip (see `this link <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/numba.html>`_ for a description of numba):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numba

For unit tests to pass you will also need the following optional requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r PyAutoArray/optional_requirements.txt

If you are using a ``conda`` environment, add each source repository as follows:

[NOTE: Certain versions of conda use the command ``conda develop`` (without a dash) instead of those shown below.]

.. code-block:: bash

   conda-develop PyAutoFit
   conda-develop PyAutoArray
   conda-develop PyAutoGalaxy

Alternatively, if you are using a Python environment include each source repository in your PYTHONPATH
(noting that you must replace the text ``/path/to`` with the path to the each directory on your computer):

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoFit
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoArray
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoGalaxy

Finally, check the unit tests run and pass for each project (you may need to install pytest via ``pip install pytest``):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/PyAutoFit
   python3 -m pytest
   cd ../PyAutoArray
   python3 -m pytest
   cd ../PyAutoGalaxy
   python3 -m pytest
